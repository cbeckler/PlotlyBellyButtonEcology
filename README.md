# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The analyst created an interactive webpage for users to explore data related to belly button bacterial ecosystems using Javascript and HTML. Users can select each participant in a dropdown menu by anonymized research ID and see dynamic visualizations that give them information about that specific participant's belly button ecology. The code used for the backend functionality may be found [here](https://github.com/cbeckler/PlotlyBellyButtonEcology/blob/main/static/charts.js) and the code for frontend visualization may be found [here](https://github.com/cbeckler/PlotlyBellyButtonEcology/blob/main/index.html).

### Deliverable

A fully interactive webpage was created. When accessed [here](https://cbeckler.github.io/PlotlyBellyButtonEcology/) it looks like this:

Users can select participants by using the dropdown menu in the top left box.

There is also hover functionality on two of the visualizations:

When hovering over the bar chart, users can see the specific bacteria that made up each culture.

Likewise, when hovering over the scatterplot, users can see the bacteria in each culture. This visulization features all cultures, not just the top ten.

## Summary

The webpage the analyst has created allows users to guide their own data explorations. Instead of data being locked behind pre-generated reports or in presentations, this format allows users the time and freedom to look into any indidual samples they may deem relevant. However, data security is maintained as this format still limits participant access to the underlying data. They can explore what they are given access to, but cannot read the raw data, nor can they change the data in any way.

This type of data reporting is ideal for datasets which users may want to explore more deeply, but which they should not have full access to. The analyst recommends this kind of interactive reporting for publicly accessible data that has a sufficient degree of complexity to make it worth investing time into.
